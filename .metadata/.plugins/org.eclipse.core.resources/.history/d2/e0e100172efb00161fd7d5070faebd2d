/* USING JAVA You are given an integer X. You must choose two adjacent digits and replace them with a single adigit that equals to the rounded up average of these two digits.

For example, from the integer X= 623315, you can obtain:

43315(by replacing 62with 4);
63315(byreplacing 23 with 3, since the average of 2 and3 is 2.5 that is rounded up to 3);
62315(by replacing 31 with 2);
62333(by replacing 15 with 3) */
